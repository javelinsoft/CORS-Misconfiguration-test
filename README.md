## Overview

The CORS Misconfiguration Test Tool is a simple web application designed to help developers test Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations for any given URL. It allows users to check whether their APIs are properly configured to handle cross-origin requests, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations.

## Features

- Input a URL to test CORS settings.
- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- Displays the HTTP response status and content.
- Indicates whether the URL is vulnerable or not based on the CORS configuration.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser to run the application.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the `CORS-test.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the URL you want to test in the input field.
4. Click the "Test CORS" button to see the results.
5. The tool will display the HTTP response and indicate if the URL is vulnerable or not.
6. The checkbox can be used to test CORS with Credentials.

### Example

1. Enter a URL (e.g., `https://restcountries.com`).
2. Click "Test CORS."
3. Review the response to determine the CORS configuration status.
